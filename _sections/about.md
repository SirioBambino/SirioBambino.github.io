Hey, I'm a Computer Science (BSc) graduate from City University of London, with a great passion for software and game development.<br />
My primary expertise lies in C#, Python, and Java, complemented by some knowledge of C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but I always love learning new things and expanding my skill set.<br />
Let's connect â€” I'm excited to join this industry and contribute to creative projects!
